                    The UK is the most preferred country for expats from UAE. The country is extremely multicultural and encourages expats to enjoy the freedom to celebrate their own cultures. The country is offering various immigration paths for foreign nationals, due to which the immigrants’ number was doubled from 5 million to 10 million.

                <p>Most of the Emirates choose UK immigration because of the following interesting reasons:</p>

                <li>Superior quality of life</li>
                <li>Better career prospects</li>
                <li>World’s renowned education system</li>

            <p>The UK government has fiscal plans for 2022 and the near future. The announcements for visa changes encourage entrepreneurs and talented individuals for UK immigration. It also re-confirmed the introduction of new visa types in 2022.</p>
            <p class="text-danger">The UK innovation strategy policy has announced two new visa routes.</p>
            <p>The year 2022 will be shaping up for big chances for UK immigration. The country is planning new routes such as Global Business Mobility and Scale-up. This introduces new visa categories and amalgamation or amendment to some existing offerings. The new High Potential Individual visa will provide user-friendly access with a closer outlook.</p>

                <li> <strong>Scale-up route:</strong> A visa for talented candidates with a job offer from a qualifying scale-up.</li>
                <li> <strong>Simplifying the Innovator route: </strong> Allowing more flexible options for funding and the ability for the applicant to work outside the primary business</li>

                Apart from these, the country is also facing labor shortages in many areas, and hence it relies upon UK immigration for highly skilled foreign nationals.</p>
