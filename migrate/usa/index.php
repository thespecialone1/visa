            <h3 class="text-danger font-weight-light">Employment-based immigration (USA work visa)</h3>
            <p>People looking for USA immigration can migrate by signing a contract with a company in the US. For this employment-based immigration, you need to search for the relevant opportunity in the country. Here work experience and educational qualifications play a crucial role. But the visa issued under this type of USA immigration through USA work visa offers a great opportunity to establish a livelihood in the country.</p>
            <h3 class="text-danger font-weight-light">Green Card Lottery</h3>

            <h3 class="text-danger font-weight-light">Family-based immigration</h3>
            <p>If you have a US citizen or Green Card holder family member, then you can choose Family-based immigration. Based on the degree of kinship, it is divided into two categories.</p>
            <p>The first category includes fiancé, spouse, unmarried children under the age of 21, and parents of US citizens or Green Card holders. They will receive their permanent residence permit within time.</p>
            <p>The second is for unmarried children above 21 years of age, of US citizens or Green Card holders. For them, it will take longer to get permanent residency.</p>

            <h3 class="text-danger font-weight-light">Immigration via investment</h3>
            <p>
                USA immigration through investment would be interesting for self-employed individuals. If you can, plan to create equity to provide jobs for at least ten people. But the capital required varies between $900,000 and $1,800,000 depending on the state.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-danger font-weight-light">USA Study Visa</h3>
