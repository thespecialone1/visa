                    Canada is a favorite destination for individuals wanting to migrate to another country. The immigration friendly policies of the country and the many job opportunities available are encouraging migrants to come and settle here.
                </p>
                <p class="text-danger">Permanent residency in Canada allows you to settle in the country on a permanent basis. You might be eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship after five years.</p>

                <p>
                    Canadian permanent residence offers social security, free education and healthcare, among other benefits. Many Canadian immigration programs are available through which you can apply for permanent residency.


                </p>
                <p>

                    A popular option is the Canadian Provincial Nominee Program or the Canada PNP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, the Canadian government has continuously increased its targets for the PNP program. It has set a target of 81,500 newcomers through Canada PNP in 2022.
                </p>

                <p>As per the Canada PNP Annual Immigration Targets 2021-2023, of the total 421,000 overall planned permanent resident admissions target for 2023, around 83,000 will get permanent residence in 2023 through Canadian PNP.</p>

                <p>Most of the Canada immigration programs — including various PNP immigration pathways or ‘streams’ — work on a points-based system.</p>
                <p>Generally, an applicant must score a minimum number of points to be able to apply for permanent residence in Canada through Canada PNP.</p>
                <p>Here are the various criteria under which you can score points to meet the eligibility requirement:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Usually, an application for Canadian permanent residence through the PNP route requires the applicants to have some kinds of a connection to the province. The connection could be either through working in that province or having studied there in the recent past. You can also be considered eligible if you have a job offer from a Canadian employer in that province/territory.</p>

                For permanent residence in Canada through the Canada PNP Program, you must begin the process by applying to the specific PNP of the province or territory that you intend to settle within.

            </p>
            <p>
                The criteria for evaluating the application differ from PNP to PNP.
            </p>
            <p>The PNP is the recommended option if your CRS points score is not high enough and you are thinking of applying for Canadian permanent residence through the federal Express Entry system. When making your PNP application you can choose a province from where it will be easy to get a nomination based on your profile.</p>
