                </div>
                <p><b>Foreign companies that are looking at expanding their business in Canada have the option of opening a subsidiary company or a branch office. If they opt to open a branch office, they will have to fulfil specific requirements.</b></p><br>
                <p><b>In order to set up a branch office in Canada and bring in employees from their main office or other offices, the company can make use of the Intra Company Transfer Work Permit.</b></p><br>
                <p><b>Intra-Company Transfer (ICT) is for employees who work for a company with a qualifying relationship with a Canadian firm, such as a subsidiary, affiliate, parent, or branch. Employers in Canada do not need an LMIA to hire employees through this scheme</b></p><br>
                <p><b>The foreign worker must have worked for the company for at least one year. He must have either worked in a managerial role or show that they have advanced and proprietary knowledge of the business or its products.</b></p><br>
                <p><b>Another advantage of this work permit is that the companies applying for the intra-company transfer need not apply for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) before making their application. This is good because getting the LMIA can be a difficult process and the opportunity to do away with this step is good news for employers.</b></p><br>
                <p><b>The duration of the intra-company transfer work permit for senior managers and executives is 7 years and for specialized knowledge workers, it’s 5 years.</b></p>
                <p><b>While the ICT can be used to move to Canada for work, it can also be used to move to Canada and start a branch office in Canada.</b></p>
                <p><b>Individuals who own a business or hold executive position in a company can use the ICT to come to Canada and open a branch here.</b></p>
