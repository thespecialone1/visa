                </div>
                <p><b>Canada has a program to grant permit for start-ups in the country. It aims to recruit dynamic entrepreneurs from around the world, bring them to Canada, and equip them with the resources they need (including money) to establish businesses that employ Canadians.</b></p>
                <p><b>The program designed by Canada for start-ups/entrepreneurs encourages immigrant entrepreneurs to develop their start-ups in Canada. Successful applicants can tie up with private companies in Canada and receive help on funding and guidance on running their business.</b></p>
                <p><b>The entrepreneur wanting to immigrate must have the support or sponsorship of a specified Canadian venture capital fund, angel investor or business incubator to qualify for permanent residence.</b></p>
                <p><b>The IRCC has designated specific venture capital funds, investor groups and business incubators to be part of this program.</b></p>
                <p><b>Under this program, candidates can come to Canada on a work permit which is sponsored by their Canada based investor and then apply for permanent residence once their business is established in the country.</b></p>
                <p><b>However, this program has clear rules on the ownership and shareholding requirements for a start-up to be eligible for the permit.</b></p>
