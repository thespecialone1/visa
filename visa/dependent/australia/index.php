                <p>
                    Australia offers Dependent Permits to almost every category of immigrants like work permit to study permit. They can bring their dependents or partners and children based on the Australia Dependent Permit.

                <h2>Subclass 309 visa (partner provisional visa)</h2>
                <p>Through this permit, the spouse or de facto partner of an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or qualified New Zealand citizen can stay in Australia on a temporary basis. The first step in Permanent Partner Permit (subclass 100) is to have a genuine relationship with the spouse or de facto partner in Australia while submitting for the permit.</p>
                <p>The Subclass 309 permit is a temporary permit and the candidate must reside outside Australia when submitting for this permit.</p>

                    <li>Travel to and from Australia as many times as needed</li>
                    <li>Attend up to 510 hours of free English language classes provided by the Adult Migrant English Program</li>
                    <li>Make use of Australia’s public health care scheme, Medicare</li>

                </ul>
